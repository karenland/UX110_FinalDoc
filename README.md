# Trial



## Introduction: 
testing the titles/headings
## Design statement: 
testing titles and headings


## Competitor analysis:
For this project, I analyzed the Goodreads application, a social app and book archive app. It is the current most popular application for book readers with around 900 million users. The second app I analyzed is an ebook app for those with U.S. library card memberships named Libby. Both of their functions are quite different from each other (social vs a digital reading app) but I thought it was important to study them since combing the information gives insight into what features book-centered apps need or lack.
