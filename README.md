## Introduction: 
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

This project provides a new outlet for aging book readers to connect with others as well as delve deeper in their reading journeys.

## Design statement: 



##Competitor analysis:
For this project, I analyzed the Goodreads application, a social app and book archive app. It is the current most popular application for book readers with around 900 million users. The second app I analyzed is an ebook app for those with U.S. library card memberships named Libby. Both of their functions are quite different from each other (social vs a digital reading app) but I thought it was important to study them since combing the information gives insight into what features book-centered apps need or lack.
